       <h2> Short information about Inna</h2>

       <p>
        Hi! I'm from Kaluga (Russia)
        I've finished a school and high education with "red diploma" (high degree).
        My first higher education is economist at customs. 
        Also I have an additional diploma for Interpreter in the professional communications (customs services and logistics).
       </p>

       <p>
        Then I had an experience of work as customs specialist and coordination work in projects of import and export of equipment and automobile parts.
        The last year was devoted to additional education: psychologist. It helps me to understand my interlocutor better and to gain common purposes.
        And this year I've heard about Rolling Scopes from my friend from Customs academy and her experience and emotions. So I was inspired to train my brain to know smth new.
        Right now I have no idea what JS or HTML or CSS are BUT that is the challenge I'd like to pass through.
        Can a blue-eye blonde girl became a junior front-end developer? Let's see it!
        Challenge accepted!
